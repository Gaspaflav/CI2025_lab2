    "The initial population is generated from a set of different greedy solutions, where each solution is built by iteratively choosing the best next node available. I constructed these greedy paths starting from various nodes (including and excluding node 0), and then adjusted them so that each tour begins at node 0.\n",

    "The mutation applied to an offspring is chosen randomly between inversion and insertion, according to a parameter called the inversion rate.\n",
    "Recombination is performed using the Inver-Over crossover operator, which is always applied. Mutation, on the other hand, is applied a random number of times depending on two parameters: mutation_prob and mutation_rate. The mutation rate gradually decreases as generations progress.\n",

However, to ensure reasonable computation times for larger instances, I used smaller parameter values. Increasing these values would likely improve solution quality, although at the cost of higher computational effort and longer execution times."
